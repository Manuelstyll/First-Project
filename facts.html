<h1 style="font-size: 50px"><u>JDM Cars as at 13 <sup>th</sup> february,2023</u></h1>
<!----this is the first car---->
<h1 style="color: lightseagreen"> <u>Nissan Skyline GT-R</u> </h1>

<p style="font-family: 'DejaVu Sans'"> <b>
Perhaps the most famous of all JDM cars, the <mark>Nissan Skyline</mark> was developed from a lineage of legendary touring cars that dominated Japanese motorsport from the late 60s onwards. While Skylines raced outside of Japan – and crushed all before them – it wasn’t until Gran Turismo made it the poster car for the PlayStation generation that it really came to worldwide fame. The R32, R33 and R33 GT-Rs of the late 90s and early 2000s are true modern icons, Nissan officially importing a tiny number of the latter two versions into the UK at the time while many were also brought in privately. Now of an age where American fans can now import them too, demand for old Skylines is up, and prices with it. </b> </p>
<!---this is the second car--->
<h1 style="color: darkblue"><u>Subaru Impreza</u></h1>
<img src="images/subaru.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300">
<p style="font-family: Waree"> <i>Before Colin McRae shot to <del>rallying</del> fame in the mid-90s Subaru was better known for building sturdy pick-ups and estate cars for farmers and other country types. McRae’s achievements changed that pretty much overnight but, while Subaru sold turbocharged Imprezas that resembled his rally car here in the UK, the WRX and STI versions the fans really wanted were never officially available outside of Japan. That didn’t stop people bringing them over, though, and legendary JDM models like the 22B, Type R coupes and improbably named WRX STI Spec C Type RA-R still have a huge following, as have STI versions of other Subaru models like the Legacy and Forester.

<!----this is the third car---->
<h1 style="color: darkred"> <u>Mitsubishi Evo</u></h1>
<img src="images/mitsubishievo.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300">
<p style="background: aqua"> <i>The Impreza’s nemesis in 90s rallying was also its biggest rival in its domestic market, the legendary Evo versions of the otherwise unremarkable Lancer saloon selling in huge numbers to home fans but rarely seen outside of Japan. The Evo’s wild looks, innovative <mark>four-wheel drive technology</mark>, incredible performance and unobtainable nature all added to its exoticism and, through its first six generations, it was always a rarer sight than the Impreza, even in its heyday. Those that did make it here were often driven hard, modified and otherwise thrashed so if you still crave a taste of 90s Evo craziness a fresh JDM import is still desirable.

<!----this is the forth car---->
<h1 style="color: darkgray"><u>Honda Integra Type <sub>R</sub> </u></h1>
<img src="images/honda.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300">
<p style="color: purple"> <b> In more recent years the Type R badge has adorned Honda hot hatches here in the. But, back in the 90s, it was a JDM-only thing, the original, high-revving Civic Type R an incredible hot hatch the Japanese pretty much kept to themselves. There were Type R versions of the amazing NSX supercar Honda again kept for the home market only, though video of Ayrton Senna driving one around Suzuka circuit back in the day did rather let the cat out of the bag there. NSX Type Rs are now incredibly sought after for this heritage and some of those original Civics made it over as well. But the definitive JDM Type R is arguably the Integra coupe, which over various generations has been regarded as one of the finest front-wheel drive performance cars of all time </b> </p>
<!----this is the fifth car---->
<h1 style="color: forestgreen"> <u>Toyota GRMN Yaris</u></h1>
<img src="images/toyota.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300">
<p style="font-family: Dialog">Tastes change and, over the years, more and more previously JDM-only sub-brands like <mark>NISMO</mark>, Type R and others have become fixtures in Japanese manufacturers’ global ranges. But, just as it seemed the age of JDM exotica was over, Toyota has reinvigorated it with a very special version of its stellar GR Yaris hot hatch. Known as the GRMN Yaris, it costs nearly twice as much as the regular GR and is available in either Circuit Package or Rally Package forms. Both feature extensive carbon bodywork, a bonnet scoop, extensive weight saving and additional welding on the bodyshell for extra stiffness. A total of just 500 will be made, all allocated in a special ballot exclusively for Japanese buyers. Chances of importing one and kickstarting a new era of JDM specials? Pretty slim, given how rare and expensive it will be. But fair play to Toyota for putting a modern spin on this classic format!
